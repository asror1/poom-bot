_Poom_ bot is your number one helper when it comes to employing the pomodoro technique right within Discord! The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
